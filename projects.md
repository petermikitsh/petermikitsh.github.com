		<div class="projtitle">Executive Office of the President</div>

		<p>As an intern on the White House's first software development team, I created a new human-capital management system for White House Operations Staff, trimming hours in office time previously on generating weekly reports by hand. A QuickBase application was used to create a notification system as changes in employee information became available.
