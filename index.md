	    nycfloods was created for the <a href="http://cnycn.org">Center for NYC Neighborhoods</a> at the JPMorgan Code for Good Challenge. The web app educates users about the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act, which raises flood insurance price for individuals living in risk areas, as identified by FEMA. Users can effortlessly tweet their legislators as nycfloods pre-fills a tweet message, including the legislator's twitter handles, based off current location.

	    #swaflies is an internal application for finding non-revenue itineraries with Southwest Airlines. While typical booking is limited by networking planning, #swaflies finds the most desirable itineraries that offer a maximum number of available seats. By utilizing a graph data structure to model the Southwest network (cities as nodes; routes as edges), combined with a service layer that provides flight and seating information, all possible itineraries are generated between two city pairs for a given date. Users can filter itinieraries multi-dimensionally by trip duration, layover time, and departure time. This web app is built on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://mixitup.io">mixitup.js</a>.

	    Applying design patterns covered in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang of Four</a> (including the Command, Strategy, Observer and State Patterns) the Mastermind game is playable from either a graphic or command line interface. Users can play against the computer, at varying degrees of algorithm difficulty. The application is built in Java and utilizes the Swing framework for GUI mode.

	    This 10-week project coordinated 5 team members to assemble a pizza ordering system. The GUI is made in Java Swing. Comprehensive statistics for pricing, preparation, cooking, and delivery times of orders are accessible through a manager report. Continual communication and feedback from the Project Champion (the course professor) simulated an Agile development process in an educational setting.

	      As an intern on the White House's first software development team, I created a new human-capital management system for White House Operations Staff, trimming hours in office time previously on generating weekly reports by hand. A QuickBase application was used to create a notification system as changes in employee information became available.
